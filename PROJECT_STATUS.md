## Ready for Next Steps

### Immediate Next Steps (Week 1)

**For Backend Developer:**
1. Read ARCHITECTURE.md and DATABASE.md
2. Set up local development environment (DEPLOYMENT.md)
3. Initialize Node.js + Express project
4. Set up Supabase connection
5. Create initial database migrations
6. Implement health check endpoint

**For Frontend Developer:**
1. Read ARCHITECTURE.md
2. Set up local development environment (DEPLOYMENT.md)
3. Initialize React Native (Expo) project
4. Create navigation structure
5. Set up API client
6. Build login/register screens

**For Project Manager:**

## Key Decisions Made

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React Native (Expo) - One codebase for web + mobile
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express - Simple, scalable, widely supported
- **Database:** PostgreSQL - Relational data with great performance
- **Auth:** Supabase Auth - Easy to implement, secure
- **Hosting:** Hetzner VPS - Cost-effective at scale

**Rationale:** Balance of developer experience, cost, and scalability.

---

### Architecture Patterns
- **Modular game systems** - Easy to add new games
- **Swiss pairing algorithm** - Industry standard for tournaments
- **Real-time updates** - Better user experience
- **Mobile-first design** - Primary use case is at tournaments

---

### Deployment Strategy
**Phase 1:** Free tier (Supabase + Railway) - Validate concept  
**Phase 2:** VPS hosting ($6-10/month) - Control + cost efficiency  
**Phase 3:** Scale as needed - Add resources gradually

**Rationale:** Start cheap, validate product-market fit, scale when needed.

- [ ] API endpoints
- [ ] UI/UX design (wireframes/mockups)
- [ ] Testing framework
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] User documentation

### To Be Decided
- [ ] Exact UI design and branding
- [ ] Logo and app icons
- [ ] Color scheme

## Success Criteria for Phase 0

✅ **Complete system architecture documented**  
✅ **Database schema fully specified**  
✅ **API contracts defined**  
✅ **Development roadmap created**  
✅ **Deployment strategy documented**  
✅ **Collaboration framework established**  

**Status: PHASE 0 COMPLETE ✅**

---

## Recommendations

### For User (Project Owner)

1. **Review all documentation** - Especially ARCHITECTURE.md and ROADMAP.md
2. **Validate Warmachine specs** - Ensure rules are correctly interpreted
3. **Set up development environment** - Follow DEPLOYMENT.md
4. **Begin Phase 1** - Start with user authentication
5. **Engage Warmachine community** - Get feedback from TOs

### For Future Claude Instances

1. **Read INDEX.md first** - Understand documentation structure
2. **Reference ARCHITECTURE.md** - For all design decisions
3. **Follow specs exactly** - DATABASE.md and API.md are contracts
4. **Ask questions early** - Better than implementing incorrectly
5. **Update docs** - When specs are ambiguous or need changes

### For Tournament Organizers (Beta Testers)

1. **Wait for MVP** - Target: February 2026
2. **Provide feedback** - On pairing algorithm, UI, features
3. **Test at real events** - Small tournaments first
4. **Report bugs** - Especially pairing edge cases
5. **Suggest improvements** - You're the primary users

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- Technology stack proven and stable
- Database design solid
- Deployment strategy tested
- Cost manageable

### Medium Risk ⚠️
- Pairing algorithm complexity (mitigation: extensive testing)
- User adoption (mitigation: focus on quality, engage community)
- Timeline ambitious (mitigation: MVP focused, flexible scope)

### High Risk ❌
- None identified at this time

---

## Financial Projection

### Development Phase (Months 1-4)
**Cost:** $0/month
- Supabase free tier
- Railway free tier
- Vercel free tier

### Beta Phase (Months 5-6)
**Cost:** $0-5/month
- May exceed free tier limits
- Still very affordable

### Production (Month 7+)
**Cost:** $6-10/month initially
- Hetzner VPS CX21: ~$6/month
- Domain: ~$1/month
- Total: Affordable for hobby project

### At Scale (1000+ users)
**Cost:** $40-65/month
- Still very reasonable
- Revenue options available if needed

- TOs can create tournaments
- Swiss pairing works correctly
- Match results recorded accurately
- Live standings display properly
- Warmachine Steamroller fully supported

**Estimated Effort:** 8-12 weeks of development
