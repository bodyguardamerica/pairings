## Remaining Work

**Frontend (Estimated 8-10 hours):**
- [ ] Public browsing: Add "Login to Register" prompts
- [ ] Player statistics: Create search screen and public profiles
- [ ] Email alerts: Create preferences UI
- [ ] Privacy: Add toggle to user profile

**Backend:**
- [ ] Integrate real email provider (SendGrid/Mailgun/AWS SES)
- [ ] Implement digest queuing for daily/weekly emails

---

## Database Changes

**Migration:** `004_add_phase0_features.sql`

**Added:**
- `tournaments.is_rated` - Boolean, default true
- `users.stats_public` - Boolean, default true
- `email_preferences` table - Full email alert system

---

## API Endpoints Added

**Email Preferences:**
- `GET /api/email-preferences`
- `POST /api/email-preferences`
- `PUT /api/email-preferences/:id`
- `DELETE /api/email-preferences/:id`
- `POST /api/email-preferences/disable-all`

**Players:**
- `GET /api/tournaments/players/search?query=username`
- `PUT /api/tournaments/players/privacy`

**Tournaments:**

---

## Technical Notes

**Email Service:** Currently mock implementation. To complete:
1. Choose provider (SendGrid/Mailgun/AWS SES)
2. Add API key to `.env`
3. Update `backend/src/services/emailService.js`

**Privacy:** Users can make stats private via privacy settings. Default is public.

**Rating:** Default is rated (affects rankings). Unrated events for practice/casual play.

---

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Users can browse tournaments without login
- ✅ Events can be marked rated/unrated
- ✅ Backend supports public player profiles
- ✅ Email infrastructure ready
- ⏳ Full frontend implementation pending
