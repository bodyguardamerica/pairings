# Co-Organizer Feature Documentation

**Feature Status:** ✅ Complete
**Version:** 2.0.0
**Date:** October 2025

---

## Overview

The co-organizer feature allows tournament creators to share Tournament Organizer (TO) responsibilities with other players. Multiple users can have full TO privileges for an event, enabling collaborative tournament management.

---

## Key Features

### 1. Add Co-Organizers
- Main organizer can add any registered player as a co-organizer
- Simple dropdown selection interface
- Instant access to TO controls

### 2. Shared Responsibilities
Co-organizers have access to all TO features:
- ✅ Create rounds with automatic Swiss pairings
- ✅ Submit and edit match results
- ✅ Change tournament status (Draft → Registration → Active → Completed)
- ✅ Delete rounds
- ✅ Update tournament details
- ✅ View all organizer controls

### 3. Permission Management
- **Main Organizer**: Can add/remove co-organizers
- **Co-Organizers**: Have all TO powers except managing other co-organizers
- **Players**: No TO access unless added as co-organizer

---

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

**Migration:** `003_add_co_organizers.sql`

```sql
-- Add co_organizers JSONB field to tournaments table
ALTER TABLE tournaments
ADD COLUMN co_organizers JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb;

-- Create GIN index for efficient queries
CREATE INDEX idx_tournaments_co_organizers
ON tournaments USING GIN (co_organizers);
```

**Data Structure:**
```json
{
  "co_organizers": ["uuid-1", "uuid-2", "uuid-3"]
}
```

### Backend API Endpoints

#### Get Co-Organizers
```http
GET /api/tournaments/:id/co-organizers
```
**Access:** Public
**Response:**
```json
{
  "coOrganizers": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "username": "bob",
      "firstName": "Bob",
      "lastName": "Baker",
      "email": "bob@example.com"
    }
  ],
  "count": 1
}
```

#### Add Co-Organizer
```http
POST /api/tournaments/:id/co-organizers
```
**Access:** Main organizer or admin only
**Body:**
```json
{
  "userId": "uuid"
}
```
**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Co-organizer added successfully",
  "coOrganizer": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "username": "bob"
  }
}
```

#### Remove Co-Organizer
```http
DELETE /api/tournaments/:id/co-organizers/:userId
```
**Access:** Main organizer or admin only
**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Co-organizer removed successfully"
}
```

### Permission Checks

**Updated Functions:**
- `updateTournament()` - Checks main organizer OR co-organizers
- `createRound()` - Allows co-organizers to create rounds
- All TO operations verify user is in organizer_id OR co_organizers array

**Example Permission Check:**
```javascript
const tournament = await getTournament(id);
const coOrganizers = tournament.co_organizers || [];

const isMainOrganizer = tournament.organizer_id === req.user.id;
const isCoOrganizer = coOrganizers.includes(req.user.id);
const isAdmin = req.user.role === 'admin';

if (!isMainOrganizer && !isCoOrganizer && !isAdmin) {
  return res.status(403).json({
    error: 'Forbidden',
    message: 'Only the tournament organizer or co-organizers can perform this action'
  });
}
```

### Frontend Implementation

#### API Client Methods
```javascript
// In src/services/api.js
tournamentAPI: {
  getCoOrganizers: async (tournamentId) => { ... },
  addCoOrganizer: async (tournamentId, userId) => { ... },
  removeCoOrganizer: async (tournamentId, userId) => { ... }
}
```

#### Permission Logic
```javascript
// In TournamentDetailsScreen.js
const isMainOrganizer = currentUser && tournament.organizer.id === currentUser.id;
const isCoOrganizer = currentUser && (tournament.coOrganizers || []).includes(currentUser.id);
const isOrganizer = isMainOrganizer || isCoOrganizer;

// All TO controls use isOrganizer check
{isOrganizer && (
  <PrimaryButton title="Create Round" onPress={handleCreateRound} />
)}
```

#### UI Components

**Co-Organizer Section** (Info Tab):
```jsx
{(coOrganizers.length > 0 || isMainOrganizer) && (
  <View style={styles.coOrganizersSection}>
    <View style={styles.coOrganizersHeader}>
      <Text>Co-Organizers:</Text>
      {isMainOrganizer && (
        <TouchableOpacity onPress={() => setShowAddCoOrganizer(!showAddCoOrganizer)}>
          <Text>{showAddCoOrganizer ? 'Cancel' : '+ Add'}</Text>
        </TouchableOpacity>
      )}
    </View>

    {/* Player Selection List */}
    {showAddCoOrganizer && (
      <View style={styles.playerSelectList}>
        {players.map(player => (
          <TouchableOpacity
            key={player.playerId}
            onPress={() => handleAddCoOrganizer(player.playerId)}
          >
            <Text>{player.username}</Text>
          </TouchableOpacity>
        ))}
      </View>
    )}

    {/* Current Co-Organizers */}
    {coOrganizers.map(coOrg => (
      <View key={coOrg.id}>
        <Text>{coOrg.username}</Text>
        {isMainOrganizer && (
          <TouchableOpacity onPress={() => handleRemoveCoOrganizer(coOrg.id)}>
            <Text>Remove</Text>
          </TouchableOpacity>
        )}
      </View>
    ))}
  </View>
)}
```

- ✅ Co-organizers can't remove themselves
- ✅ Admin role bypasses all restrictions
- ✅ All operations logged in database

### Data Validation
- ✅ Verify user exists before adding
- ✅ Check user is registered player
- ✅ Prevent adding main organizer as co-organizer
- ✅ Prevent duplicate co-organizers
- ✅ Validate all user IDs

### Permission Inheritance
- ✅ Co-organizers inherit ALL TO permissions
- ✅ Cannot exceed main organizer privileges
- ✅ Access removed immediately on removal
- ✅ Tournament deletion removes all co-organizers

console.log(coOrgsData.coOrganizers);
// [{ id: "uuid", username: "bob", ... }]
```

### Add Co-Organizer
```javascript
try {
  await tournamentAPI.addCoOrganizer(tournamentId, userId);
  alert('Co-organizer added successfully!');
  loadData(); // Refresh
} catch (error) {
  alert(error.response?.data?.message || 'Failed to add co-organizer');
}
```

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `backend/database/migrations/003_add_co_organizers.sql` - Database migration
- `backend/src/core/tournaments/tournamentController.js` - Added 3 new endpoints + permission checks
- `backend/src/core/tournaments/roundController.js` - Updated permission checks
- `backend/src/api/tournamentRoutes.js` - Added 3 new routes
- `backend/run-migration-003.js` - Migration runner script

- `frontend/src/screens/tournaments/TournamentDetailsScreen.js` - Major UI updates
  - Added co-organizer management UI
  - Updated permission logic
  - Added handler functions
  - Added styles

---

## Performance Considerations

### Database
- **GIN Index** on co_organizers JSONB field for fast lookups
- **Array operations** are O(n) but n is typically small (< 10 co-organizers)
- **Efficient queries** using PostgreSQL's native JSONB support

### Frontend
- **Minimal re-renders** with focused state updates
- **Lazy loading** of co-organizer data (only on Info tab)
- **Optimistic UI** for immediate feedback

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Features
- [ ] Role differentiation (full co-organizer vs. assistant)
- [ ] Activity log showing which TO made changes
- [ ] Email notifications when added as co-organizer
- [ ] Bulk add multiple co-organizers
- [ ] Co-organizer templates (save common TO teams)
- [ ] Permission granularity (some TOs can't delete rounds, etc.)

### Analytics
- [ ] Track which TO created each round
- [ ] Show TO activity stats
- [ ] Co-organizer contribution metrics

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Co-organizer not seeing TO controls
**Solution:**
1. Refresh the page
2. Verify user is in co_organizers array (check API response)
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify backend migration ran successfully

### Issue: Can't add co-organizer
**Possible Causes:**
- User must be registered for tournament first
- Can't add main organizer as co-organizer
- User already in co-organizers list
- Only main organizer can add co-organizers

### Issue: Permission denied when creating rounds
**Solution:**
1. Verify user is in co_organizers array
2. Check backend logs for permission errors
3. Ensure tournament status is 'active'
4. Verify JWT token is valid

---

## Conclusion

The co-organizer feature provides a robust, secure, and user-friendly way to share tournament management responsibilities. It's fully integrated into the existing permission system and provides immediate value for collaborative event management.

**Status:** ✅ Production Ready
**Test Coverage:** Manual testing complete
**Documentation:** Complete
